#Rain Prediction Model Documentation
##Introduction

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest, from the scikit-learn library. By leveraging historical weather data, the project demonstrates how decision-based algorithms can provide accurate and insightful predictions.

The goal is to analyze weather features, preprocess the data, train the models, and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.


##Overview:

- Downloading a real-world dataset
- Preparing a dataset for training
- Training and interpreting decision trees
- Training and interpreting random forests
- Overfitting & hyperparameter tuning
- Making predictions on single inputs


## Problem Statement

This tutorial takes a practical and coding-focused approach. We'll learn how to apply _logistic regression_ to a real-world dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets):

> The [Rain in Australia dataset](https://kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. Here's a small sample from the dataset:

##Insights:

- Certain features like Humidity and Temperature showed strong correlations with rainfall likelihood.
- Outliers were detected and treated appropriately to ensure robust model performance.

##Preprocessing Steps:

- Missing Values: Handled using imputation techniques for continuous and categorical features.
- Feature Encoding: Converted categorical data (if any) into numerical format using methods like One-Hot Encoding.
- Feature Scaling: Applied normalization or standardization for better model performance (e.g., for algorithms sensitive to scale like Random Forest).


##Model Training

Two models were trained and evaluated:

1. Decision Tree: A single tree-based model that splits data into smaller subsets based on feature thresholds.
2. Random Forest: An ensemble model that aggregates the predictions of multiple Decision Trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.

##Hyperparameter Tuning

Key hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance:

- Decision Tree:
  - max_depth: Controlled the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting.
  - min_samples_split: Minimum samples required to split an internal node.
- Random Forest:
  - n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest.
  - max_depth: Limited the depth of each tree.
  - max_features: Number of features considered for each split.


##Conclusion

This project highlights the potential of Decision Tree and Random Forest models in rain prediction tasks. Key takeaways include:

- Feature Importance: Weather features like Humidity and Temperature play a crucial role in determining rainfall.
- Model Performance: Random Forest provided more reliable predictions, benefiting from ensemble learning.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Significant improvements were observed after fine-tuning parameters like max_depth and n_estimators.
